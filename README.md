# Wikipedia Captcha

This is a code dump of a captcha system I started work on. It is 
based on the idea of generating captcha questions from facts 
found in Wikipedia articles.

Please note that this code is not currently in a state suitable 
for immediate use. I have discontinued my own use and 
development of this system. However, I may convert this code dump into 
a usable composer package if there is enough interest.
